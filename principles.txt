First:
The state of your whole app is stored in an object tree within a single store.
which will be managed by the Redux store.

{
  numberOfCakes : 10
}

Second:
The only way to change the state is to emit an action,an object describes what happened.

{
  type: BUY_CAKE
}

Third:
To specify how the state tree is transformed by action, you write pure reducers.
Reducer - (prevState,action)=>newState

Cake Shop:

Shopkeeper is the reducer.

const reducer = (state,action) =>{
  switch(action.type){
    case BUY_CAKE: return {
      numberOfCakes: state.numberOfCakes - 1
    }
  }
}
